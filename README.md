# Data-Wrangling-Udacity

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. We documented our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
